            Fault Tree Viewer
            This program comes preloaded with 3 fault trees which can be alternated between by
            pressing the 1/2/3 keys on the keyboard. The keypress functions operate using a
            switch statement which performs different functions depending on the key you press.
            The fault trees are composed on 4 different objects: OrGate, AndGate, BasicEvent and
            TransferGate. These are all drawn using the pContext.moveTo/LineTo functions. The AndGate
            uses pContext.arc to draw a semi circle arc. The OrGate is drawn completely using bezier
            curves. BasicEvents and TransferGates are drawn using a algorithm which draws around a
            centre point depending on the number of segments which the viewer has been programmed to
            draw.

        In the top right corner of the screen is the mini map, this displays a complete view
        of each fault tree and shows you exactly where you are on the tree, which is indicated
        by a red rectangle inside the mini map showing the current field of view.
        The mini map is basically the fault tree being redrawn again inside the rectangle and
        scaled down to fit inside. It uses the same panning function as the main fault tree but
        the numbers are negated. This is because when you want to view the right hand side of the
        tree, you are actually dragging left to move to the right of the tree. If the pan values were
        positive, the mini map viewing rectangle would move in the opposite direction. The viewing rectangle
        also zooms in when you do on the main tree. A separate scaling variable is used on the rectangle so
        that it zooms in when you zoom out on the canvas and vice versa.

        As mentioned with the mini map. The viewer has a zooming functionality which operates using the mouses
        scroll wheel. Javascript has an event called wheelDelta which can be used to determine what happens when
        you scroll the mouse wheel back or forward one increment. The zooming works by reducing the scale (scrolling
        back) or increasing the scale (scrolling forward). There is also a boundary put in place to stop the viewer
        from zooming too far out (below the scale of 0).

        You can pan the fault tree on the canvas by clicking on the mouse and dragging (unaffected by scale besides going
        slower when zoomed in by a large amount. Panning is done by making use of a vector object which has add and subtract
        functions programmed into it. These functions allow the calculations of the panning to be applied. Whenever the canvas
        is panned, it is basically constantly redrawing on the new coordinates it has been translated to. The canvas dynamically
        captures the current mouse positions and the previous mouse positions using the event clientX/Y functions for finding
        mouse positions on the canvas. The previous mouse positions is subtracted from the current mouse position to leave a value
        which is the offset between the two positions. Whenever the canvas is panning, the pan vector is constantly calculating
        the new positions of the fault tree.

		<p>
        The fault tree itself is drawn and translated using a recursive function which works out the amount of child the tree has
        and translates it accordingly using an algorithm. This is dynamic, so despite only having 3 fault trees preloaded, any amount
        of nodes can be added to the tree and it would calculate the precise amount of space needed and draw the lines between. The
        recursive function will constantly loop on itself until all of the children of that tree have been found. With each increment
        of the loop, the branch width also increases to the amount of children that parent has. The children are translated by a
        context.translate which is based off dividing the total width, the child width and the previous child's width.

        The program can toggle between fixed and dynamic sizing by pressing the D key. The default setting is fixed so pressing
        D it will enable dynamic sizing. The dynamic sizing of the canvas means that the entire canvas will scale according to
        the size of the browser window.
